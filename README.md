Dallas Food Inspection Data Analysis and Visualization

Data from Dallas food inspections were analyzed. Using Alteryx and Talend, I created a Dimensional Model for the provided dataset on Bigdata, and I built ETL pipelines to process, clean, and create dimensions and facts in the destination database. Furthermore, using Tableau and PowerBI, I visualized the necessary database details.
